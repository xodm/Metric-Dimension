- If the resolving set is green then it resolves the graph, if red it does not.
  
Probably won't update, if I do it will show family of graphs.

## __What is the Metric Dimension of a graph G?__

Given $u,v, w\in V(G)$, we say $w$ _resolves_ $u$ and $v$ if the distance from $w$ to $u$ is different from the distance from $w$ to $v$. We say the set $W$ is a resolving set if every pair of vertices in $G$ is resolved by some vertex in $W$. The cardinality of the smallest possible resolving set of a graph $G$ is the _metric dimension_, denoted $\beta(G)$.
